1a) The command echo will simply display the line of text after it has been typed.
Therefore echo hello world will print hello world after hitting enter.

1b)In this command we are using echo again, however the string to text in no longer printed as is.
The "{xn,yn}", where x and y is some conbination of letter and n represents the consecutative bracket, acts using something comparable to the distribuative property.
The first output after this command is consents, which is a combination of x1-x3.
The second output is consented, which is x1+x2+y2.
The outputs continue this way with all possible combinations, 8 in total.

1c)date prints the current date and time, this corresponds to the computer's settings.

1d)whoami returns a string that reads the user's id

1e)The command cal will print a full 12 month calender, the argument 2000 with the command returns the calender for the year 2000.

1f) In this case the arguements to cal are 9 and 1752, which will return an output of the 9th month of the year 1752.
This one is unusal because there are dates missing, the calender counts 1, 2, then 14-30. This is because of England's switch from the Julian calender to the Gregorian calender.

1g) bc is a calulator like command. bc -l outputs information about the math library.

1h) This command makes use of the commands echo and bc, by computing the arguement of echo with the math library. Output of 5+4 is 9.
