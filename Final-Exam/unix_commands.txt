# part (a)
# How would you print the file classlist.csv to the screen
# except the two header lines?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.

cat classlist.csv | tail -130
##I first ran cat -n classlist.csv to find that the file contains
##132 lines of text. And then the command prints the last 130, lines
##which excluses the header lines.


# part (b)
# How would you construct a pipeline using the command from part (a)
# to determine how many distinct students are in this list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the number
# of students in the list.

cat classlist.csv | tail -130 | cat -n

## This prints the file excluding the top two header lines. It also 
## numbers the student information. There are 130 students in total.


# part (c)
# How would you sort the list by the second column (i.e., by
# "First Name")? Which student (provide first and last name) would be
# at the top of the list? Which student would be at the bottom of the
# list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the names
# of the first and last students in the new list.

for line in classlist.csv; for element in line; if element == 1; do sort; done

## Anastasia, Weatherford would be first and Vergie Alcazar will be last.


# part (d)
# Construct a Unix pipeline involving these functions to determine
# how many students have the same first name. Which first names are
# repeated in the class list?
# Enter the relevant name(s) and the Unix command(s) below.

cut -c "100??????" classlist.csv #This should remove all the student id numbers from the file.
cut -d ",*" classlist.csv  # This should remove the last column, so that we are left only with first names.
uniq -d classlist.csv   #This will then print the duplicated first names.
Combined as a pipe:
cat classlist.csv | cut -c "100??????" | cut -d ", *" | uniq -d

# part (f) [BONUS]
# Construct a Unix pipeline that extracts the last three digits of
# the student number and the first character of the first name to make
# a four-character identifier for each student.
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.
