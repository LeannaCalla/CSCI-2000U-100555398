2b) After opening the data with Libre Office I deleted the unnessary files.
I then resaved the file as a CSV file. I found that the CSV file had 
unnecessay spaces. I wrote some python code that when through each character 
of the CSV an removed the spaces, but checking to see if each character was
equivalent to a space.
