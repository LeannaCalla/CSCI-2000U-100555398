2b) After opening the data with Libre Office I deleted the unnessary files.
I then resaved the file as a CSV file. I found that the CSV file had 
unnecessay spaces. I wrote some python code that when through each character 
of the CSV an removed the spaces, but checking to see if each character was
equivalent to a space.

In additon to the 4 required files, I have sumbitting change.py, which is the 
python file that I used to clean up my CSV file.

I recieved some help from Michael Stergianis.
